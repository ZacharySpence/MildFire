How ID's work:
-100-199 = general items/companions
-200 + 10 = LEADERS (210,220,230,240) (so even hundreds)
-210-219 => item cards for that group
-300 = ENEMIES. includes the boss and their units (so odd hundreds).
i.e 300 = enemy boss, whereas 200 = leader equiv

so i.e 
310-329 = Berry bunch boss + enemy units (gives 19 units/items to make!)
210-229 = berry bunch leader + playerUnits + items
berry start cards = [210(equiv of 310 boss),212(equiv of 312),215,100]
